# GitHub Name Mapper

This Node.js script generates commits on GitHub to create a pattern of your name on a GitHub contribution map. It asks for your name, converts it to uppercase, and maps your name using commit activity on a GitHub repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- Git (https://git-scm.com)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install

# Usage

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
   The script will prompt you to enter your name in the terminal. Enter your name and press Enter.
3. Sit back and watch as the script generates commits on GitHub based on your name.

## Features

- **Customization:** Modify the `alphabetIndices` object in `index.js` to create different patterns on the contribution map.

## Example

After running the script, visit your GitHub profile's contribution map for the year 2018 to see the magic! You'll notice commit activity forming your name pattern.

## Notes

- Ensure you have a GitHub account and proper permissions to push commits to a repository.
